:Manual group: LDMS sampler

SYNOPSIS
========

| Within ldmsctl
| ldmsctl> config name=perfevent [ <attr>=<value> ]

DESCRIPTION
===========

With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), plugins for the
ldmsd (ldms daemon) are configured via ldmsd_controller or a
configuration file. The perfevent sampler plugin runs on the nodes and
provides data about the the occurrence of micro-architectural events
using linux perfevent subsystem by accessing hardware performance
counters.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

You will need to build LDMS with --enable-perfevent. Perfevent subsystem
is available since Linux 2.6.31.

CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
==============================

The perfevent plugin uses the sampler_base base class. This man page
covers only the configuration attributes, or those with default values,
specific to the this plugin. See :ref:`ldms_sampler_base(7) <ldms_sampler_base>` for the
attributes of the base class; those attributes are specified as part of
the 'init' action arguments.

**config**

| name=<plugin_name> action<action_name> [schema=<sname>]
| configuration line

   name=<plugin_name>
      |
      | This MUST be perfevent.

   schema=<schema>
      |
      | Optional schema name. It is intended that the same sampler on
        different nodes with different metrics have a different schema.

   action=init
      |
      | Perform initialization

   action=del metricname=<string>
      |
      | Deletes the specified event.

   action=ls
      |
      | List the currently configured events.

   action=add metricname=<string> pid=<int> cpu=<int> type=<int> id=<int>
      |
      | Adds a metric to the list of configured events.
      | metricname
      | The metric name for the event
      | pid
      | The PID for the process being monitored. The counter will follow
        the process to whichever CPU/core is in use. Note that 'pid' and
        'cpu' are mutually exclusive.
      | cpu
      | Count this event on the specified CPU. This will accumulate
        events across all PID that land on the specified CPU/core. Note
        that 'pid' and 'cpu' are mutually exclusive.
      | type
      | The event type.
      | id
      | The event id.

   | The pid and cpu arguments allow specifying which process and CPU to
     monitor:
   | pid == 0 and cpu == -1
   | This measures the calling process/thread on any CPU.
   | pid == 0 and cpu >= 0
   | This measures the calling process/thread only when running on the
     specified CPU.
   | pid > 0 and cpu == -1
   | This measures the specified process/thread on any CPU.
   | pid > 0 and cpu >= 0
   | This measures the specified process/thread only when running on the
     specified CPU.
   | pid == -1 and cpu >= 0
   | This measures all processes/threads on the specified CPU. This
     requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability or a
     /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid value of less than 1.
   | pid == -1 and cpu == -1
   | This setting is invalid and will return an error.

   **type**
      |
      | This field specifies the overall event type. It has one of the
        following values:
      | PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE
      | This indicates one of the "generalized" hardware events provided
        by the kernel. See the id field definition for more details.
      | PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE
      | This indicates one of the software-defined events provided by
        the kernel (even if no hardware support is available).
      | PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT
      | This indicates a tracepoint provided by the kernel tracepoint
        infrastructure.
      | PERF_TYPE_HW_CACHE
      | This indicates a hardware cache event. This has a special
        encoding, described in the id field definition.
      | PERF_TYPE_RAW
      | This indicates a "raw" implementation-specific event in the id
        field.
      | PERF_TYPE_BREAKPOINT (since Linux 2.6.33)
      | This indicates a hardware breakpoint as provided by the CPU.
        Breakpoints can be read/write accesses to an address as well as
        execution of an instruction address.

   **id**
      |
      | This specifies which event you want, in conjunction with the
        type field.
      | There are various ways to set the id field that are dependent on
        the value of the previously described type field.
      | What follows are various possible settings for id separated out
        by type.
      | If type is PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE, we are measuring one of the
        generalized hardware CPU events. Not all of these are available
        on all platforms. Set id to one of the following:
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES
      | Total cycles. Be wary of what happens during CPU frequency
        scaling.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS
      | Retired instructions. Be careful, these can be affected by
        various issues, most notably hardware interrupt counts.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_REFERENCES
      | Cache accesses. Usually this indicates Last Level Cache accesses
        but this may vary depending on your CPU. This may include
        prefetches and coherency messages; again this depends on the
        design of your CPU.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_MISSES
      | Cache misses. Usually this indicates Last Level Cache misses;
        this is intended to be used in conjunction with the
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_REFERENCES
      | event to calculate cache miss rates.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS
      | Retired branch instructions. Prior to Linux 2.6.35, this used
        the wrong event on AMD processors.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_MISSES
      | Mispredicted branch instructions.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_BUS_CYCLES
      | Bus cycles, which can be different from total cycles.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_FRONTEND (since Linux 3.0)
      | Stalled cycles during issue.
      | PERF_COUNT_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_BACKEND (since Linux 3.0)
      | Stalled cycles during retirement.

   | PERF_COUNT_HW_REF_CPU_CYCLES (since Linux 3.3)
   | Total cycles; not affected by CPU frequency scaling.
   | If type is PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE, we are measuring software events
     provided by the kernel. Set config to one of the following:
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_CLOCK
   | This reports the CPU clock, a high-resolution per-CPU timer.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_TASK_CLOCK
   | This reports a clock count specific to the task that is running.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS
   | This reports the number of page faults.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_CONTEXT_SWITCHES
   | This counts context switches. Until Linux 2.6.34, these were all
     reported as user-space events, after that they are reported as
     happening in the kernel.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_MIGRATIONS
   | This reports the number of times the process has migrated to a new
     CPU.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS_MIN
   | This counts the number of minor page faults. These did not require
     disk I/O to handle.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS_MAJ
   | This counts the number of major page faults. These required disk
     I/O to handle.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_ALIGNMENT_FAULTS (since Linux 2.6.33)
   | This counts the number of alignment faults. These happen when
     unaligned memory accesses happen; the kernel can handle these but
     it reduces performance. This happens only on some architectures
     (never on x86).
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_EMULATION_FAULTS (since Linux 2.6.33)
   | This counts the number of emulation faults. The kernel sometimes
     traps on unimplemented instructions and emulates them for user
     space. This can negatively impact performance.
   | PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY (since Linux 3.12)
   | This is a placeholder event that counts nothing. Informational
     sample record types such as mmap or comm must be associated with an
     active event. This dummy event allows gathering such records
     without requiring a counting event.
   | If type is PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT, then we are measuring kernel
     tracepoints. The value to use in id can be obtained from under
     debugfs tracing/events/*/*/id if ftrace is enabled in the kernel.
   | If type is PERF_TYPE_HW_CACHE, then we are measuring a hardware CPU
     cache event. To calculate the appropriate id value use the
     following equation:
   | (perf_hw_cache_id) \| (perf_hw_cache_op_id << 8) \|
     (perf_hw_cache_op_result_id << 16)
   | where perf_hw_cache_id is one of:
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_L1D
   | for measuring Level 1 Data Cache
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_L1I
   | for measuring Level 1 Instruction Cache
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_LL
   | for measuring Last-Level Cache
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_DTLB
   | for measuring the Data TLB
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_ITLB
   | for measuring the Instruction TLB
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_BPU
   | for measuring the branch prediction unit
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_NODE (since Linux 3.1)
   | for measuring local memory accesses
   | and perf_hw_cache_op_id is one of
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_OP_READ
   | for read accesses
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_OP_WRITE
   | for write accesses
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_OP_PREFETCH
   | for prefetch accesses and perf_hw_cache_op_result_id is one of
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_RESULT_ACCESS
   | to measure accesses
   | PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_RESULT_MISS
   | to measure misses
   | If type is PERF_TYPE_RAW, then a custom "raw" id value is needed.
     Most CPUs support events that are not covered by the "generalized"
     events. These are implementation defined; see your CPU manual (for
     example the Intel Volume 3B documentation or the AMD BIOS and
     Kernel Developer Guide). The libpfm4 library can be used to
     translate from the name in the architectural manuals to the raw hex
     value perf_event_open() expects in this field.

NOTES
=====

The official way of knowing if perf_event_open() support is enabled is
checking for the existence of the file
/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid.

The enum values for type and id are specified in kernel. Here are the
values in version 3.9 (retrieved from
http://lxr.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/lxr/linux+v3.9/include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h#L28):

EXAMPLES
========

The following is a short example that measures 4 events.
   |
   | Total CPU cycles
   | Total CPU instructions
   | Total branch instructions
   | Mispredicted branch instructions

| IF we set the value of PID=1234 and CPU_NUM is -1, this measures the
  process with pid=1234 on any CPU. If the CPU_NUM is 1, this measures
  the process with pid=1234 only on CPU 1.
| IF we set the value of PID=-1 and CPU_NUM is 1, this measures all
  processes/threads on the CPU number 1. This requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN
  capability or a /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid value of less
  than 1.
