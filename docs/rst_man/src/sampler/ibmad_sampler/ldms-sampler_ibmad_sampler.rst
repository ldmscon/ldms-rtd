Man page for the LDMS ibmad_sampler plugin

:Manual group: LDMS sampler

SYNOPSIS
========

| Within ldmsd_controller or a configuration file:
| config name=ibmad_sampler [ <attr>=<value> ]

DESCRIPTION
===========

With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), plugins for the
ldmsd (ldms daemon) are configured via ldmsd_controller or a
configuration file. The ibmad_sampler plugin provides a metric set for
each infiniband port discovered on the node.

The schema is named "ibmad_sampler" by default.

NOTE: This plugin will not currently work with virtual IB devices.

CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
==============================

**config**
   | name=<plugin_name> [schema=<schema_name>] [job_set=<metric set
     name>]
   | configuration line

   name=<plugin_name>
      |
      | This MUST be ibmad_sampler.

   schema=<schema_name>
      |
      | The schema name defaults to "ibmad_sampler", but it can be
        renamed at the user's choice.

   rate=0
      |
      | Stop the default inclusion of rate values in the set.

   job_set=<metric set name>
      |
      | The name of the metric set that contains the job id information
        (default=job_id)

   include=PORTLIST
      |
      | Ignore any devices and ports discovered that are not matched by
        PORTLIST. See PORTLIST below. Cannot be combined with the
        exclude option.

   exclude=PORTLIST
      |
      | Collect all devices and ports discovered and active that are not
        matched by PORTLIST. See PORTLIST below. Cannot be combined with
        the include option.

PORTLIST
========

Providing a port list specification will stop the automated discovery
process at every sample time from requerying devices and ports that are
not of interest, eliminating nuisance log messages from the MAD
libraries. Such messages are frequently seen on systems using
SocketDirect hardware.

The port list is a comma-separated list of CA name and optionally
number. E.g. "mlx4_0.1,mlx4_1". A device name specified without a port
number (.N) matches all ports on that device. The maximum port number
supported for a single device is 63. Including a device or port which
does not exist or is not active in the port list has no effect on the
metric sets reported.

BUGS
====

No known bugs.

NOTES
=====

The rates reported are computed from the last sample taken and the
present sample; however the last sample may not have been stored
downstream and the sample interval size may vary due to kernel wakeup
variations. Rate values are set to -1 for samples where the rate
computation is invalid.

EXAMPLES
========

Within ldmsd_controller or a configuration file:

::

   load name=ibmad_sampler
   config name=ibmad_sampler
   start name=ibmad_sampler interval=1000000

::

   load name=ibmad_sampler
   config name=ibmad_sampler include=hfi1_0.1 rate=0
   start name=ibmad_sampler interval=1000000

::

   load name=ibmad_sampler
   config name=ibmad_sampler exclude=mlx5_0.2,mlx5_0.3,mlx5_0.4,
   start name=ibmad_sampler interval=1000000
