SYNOPSIS
========

| Within ldmsd_controller or a configuration file:
| config name=blob_stream_writer [ <attr>=<value> ]

DESCRIPTION
===========

With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), plugins for the
ldmsd (ldms daemon) are configured via ldmsd_controller or a
configuration file. The blob_stream_writer plugin writes out raw stream
messages and offsets of the messages in separate files. Messages are not
appended with ' or ' '. Multiple streams may be specified.

CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
==============================

**config**
   | name=blob_stream_writer path=<path> container=<container>
     stream=<stream> debug=1
   | configuration line

   name=<plugin_name>
      |
      | This MUST be blob_stream_writer.

   path=<path>
      |
      | path to the directory of the output files

   container=<container>
      |
      | directory of the output file

   stream=<stream>
      |
      | stream to which to subscribe. This argument may be repeated.
        Each stream will be written in a separate file pair.

   debug=1
      |
      | Enable logging of messages stored to the log file.

   timing=1
      |
      | Enable writing timestamps to a separate file.

spool=1
   |
   | Move closed files to the directory <path>/<container>/spool/.

--col-sep=C
   |
   | Use character C instead of comma as the separator in output files.
     Note some characters must be escaped in most shells, for example
     --col-sep=  replaces comma with pipe.

OUTPUT FORMAT
=============

There is no requirement that any message must the same format as any
other.

The writer writes all messages received to a file pair:
$path/$container/$stream.OFFSET.$create_time
$path/$container/$stream.DAT.$create_time where OFFSET is the byte
offsets into the corresponding .DAT of the messages seen on the stream.

Each byte offset is written as a little-endian 64 bit number. Data read
from .OFFSET should be converted to host order with le64toh.

Both DAT and OFFSET files begin with an 8 byte magic number: blobdat\0
and bloboff\0, respectively.

Optionally (if timing=1 given) the additional file
$path/$container/$stream.TIMING.$create_time is created containing
binary timestamps corresponding to the messages. The TIMING file begins
with an 8 byte magic number: blobtim\0. Each time is the delivery time
to the plugin performing the blob storage. Each timestamp is written to
the .TIMING file as a binary pair (tv_sec, tv_usec) with each value
stored as a little-endian 64 bit value which should be read and then
converted with le64toh.

NOTES
=====

This writer is in development and may be changed at any time.

Cannot support stream=.\* as there is no corresponding regex
subscription policy currently available in the C stream API.

The config operation may called at any time or repeated. The start and
stop operations will start and stop storage of all streams.

The plugin appears in C code as a sampler plugin, since the storage
policy and store plugin interfaces are set-oriented and no sets are
involved here.

EXAMPLES
========

Within ldmsd_controller or a configuration file:

::

   load name=blob_stream_writer
   config name=blob_stream_writer path=/writer/streams container=${CLUSTER} stream=foo stream=slurm stream=kokkos
   start name=name=blob_stream_writer

Examining offsets in a shell:

::

   od od -A d -t u8 -j 8 -w8 slurm.OFFSET.1624033344 |sed -e 's/[0-9,A-F,a-f]* *//'

Examining timestamps in a shell:

::

   od -A d -j 8 -t u8
